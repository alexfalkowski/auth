# Auth

A service for all your authn and authz needs.

## Background

A list of articles we have found useful to make this service:
- https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Microservices_security.html
- https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/token-best-practices

## Server

The server is composed of the below operations.

### OAuth 2.0

This service supports the following endpoints:
- [Token endpoint](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/protocols/oauth#token-endpoint)
- [JSON Web Key Sets](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/json-web-tokens/json-web-key-sets)

### Generate Password

The service allows you to generate a secure password. The system uses:
- https://github.com/sethvargo/go-password
- https://github.com/matthewhartstonge/argon2

The user can specify a length. The default is 32 and above.

We take recommendations from [NIST Password Guidelines](https://blog.netwrix.com/2022/11/14/nist-password-guidelines).

### Generate Key

The service allows you to generate a secure public and private keys.

#### RSA

The service will create a key pair using 4096 bits. This is the default or when you pass the kind `rsa`.

#### Ed25519

The service will generate a key pair of [Ed25519](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/). This is achieved by passing the `ed25519` kind.

### Generate Access Token

Access tokens are generated with RSA key pair as created by the key service. The user can specify a length. The default is 32 and above.

Once this is generated it is configured as follows:

```yaml
key:
  rsa:
    public: base64-public-key
    private: base64-private-key
```

These keys should be stored and retrieved from an [application configuration system](https://github.com/alexfalkowski/konfig).

The service needs administrators to create these access tokens. This is configured as follows:

```yaml
server:
  v1:
    admins:
      - id: su-1234
        hash: password-hash
```

Each admin has an id and a hash. The password and hash are generated by the password service. The user then sends `id:password` as [Basic Authentication](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/basic-authentication/). This will give you an encrypted access token. This token is a password that is encrypted with the public key. So you could always generate your own token if needed.

The password and token should be stored and retrieved from an [application configuration system](https://github.com/alexfalkowski/konfig). The hash is safe to just leave as is, not need to securely store it.

### Issuer

This is used to add the issuer to service tokens. This is configured as follows:

```yaml
server:
  v1:
    issuer: https://auth.falkowski.io
```

### Get Public Key

The service allows you to get the public key by kind. The supported kinds are the same as generating a key.

### Generate Service Tokens

Service tokens are generated using Ed25519 key pair. Once this is generated it is configured as follows:

```yaml
key:
  ed25519:
    public: base64-public-key
    private: base64-private-key or env:VARIABLE
```

The system generates service tokens from the access tokens. This is configured as follows:

```yaml
server:
  v1:
    services:
      - id: e1602e185cba2a90d8bbcfc3f3c5530c
        name: service-name
        hash: password-hash
        duration: 24h
```

Each service has an id, hash and duration. The access token is generated by the access token service. The user then sends the access token as [Bearer Authentication](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/). This will give you an encrypted service token with subject, audience and issuer that is valid for the duration.

#### JWT

The system will by default generate [JWT tokens](https://jwt.io/), or if we specify kind to be `jwt`.

#### Paseto

The system will generate a [paseto token](https://github.com/paseto-standard/paseto-spec) if the kind that is passed in is `paseto`.

### Validate Service Tokens

The systems allows the validation of service tokens. The token is passed as [Bearer Authentication](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/) along with a kind, audience and action.

#### Casbin

[Casbin](https://github.com/casbin/casbin) is used to authorize the token. Currently it is configured using ACL, using the following:

```yaml
casbin:
  model: |
    [request_definition]
    r = sub, obj, act

    [policy_definition]
    p = sub, obj, act

    [policy_effect]
    e = some(where (p.eft == allow))

    [matchers]
    m = r.sub == p.sub && r.obj == p.obj && r.act == p.act
  policy: |
    p, subject, audience, action
```

##### Policy

Here is an explanation of the different terms:
- `Subject`: This is the current service that gets the token to send to the service.
- `Audience`: Is the destination service you will be sending the token to.
- `Action`: Is the action/method of the service you are trying to authorize against.

## Client

The client provides a few options.

### Token

The client can perform actions on tokens.

```bash
❯ ./auth token --help
Perform actions with tokens.

Usage:
  auth token [flags]

Flags:
  -g, --generate string   generate a service token
  -h, --help              help for token
  -v, --verify string     verify a service token

Global Flags:
  -i, --input string   input config location (format kind:location) (default "env:AUTH_CONFIG_FILE")
```

This is configured as follows:

```yaml
client:
  v1:
    host: server_host
    timeout: 1s
    access: token generated by server
```

### Rotate

There might be a need to rotate all the server configuration. This is why we have the rotate command.

```bash
❯ ./auth rotate --help
Regenerate an existing configuration.

Usage:
  auth rotate [flags]

Flags:
  -a, --admins          admins configuration
  -h, --help            help for rotate
  -o, --output string   output config location (format kind:location) (default "env:AUTH_APP_CONFIG_FILE")
  -s, --services        services configuration

Global Flags:
  -i, --input string   input config location (format kind:location) (default "env:AUTH_CONFIG_FILE")
```
