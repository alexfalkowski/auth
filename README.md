# Auth

A service for all your authn and authz needs.

## Background

A list of articles we have found useful to make this service:
- https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Microservices_security.html
- https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/token-best-practices

## Generate Password

The service allows you to generate a secure password. The system uses:
- https://github.com/sethvargo/go-password
- https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt

We take recommendations from [NIST Password Guidelines](https://blog.netwrix.com/2022/11/14/nist-password-guidelines).

## Generate Key

The service allows you to generate a secure public and private keys.

### RSA

The service will create a key pair using 4096 bits. This is the default or when you pass the kind `rsa`.

### Ed25519

The service will generate a key pair of [Ed25519](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/). This is achieved by passing the `ed25519` kind.

## Generate Access Token

Access tokens are generated with RSA key pair as created by the key service. Once this is generated it is configured as follows:

```yaml
server:
  v1:
    key:
      rsa:
        public: base64_public_key
        private: base64_private_key
```

These keys should be stored and retrieved from an [application configuration system](https://github.com/alexfalkowski/konfig).

The service needs administrators to create these access tokens. This is configured as follows:

```yaml
server:
  v1:
    admins:
      - id: su-1234
        hash: bcrypt-password
```

Each admin has an id and a hash. The password and hash are generated by the password service. The user then sends `id:password` as [Basic Authentication](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/basic-authentication/). This will give you an encrypted access token. This token is a password that is encrypted with the public key. So you could always generate your own token if needed.

The password and token should be stored and retrieved from an [application configuration system](https://github.com/alexfalkowski/konfig). The hash is safe to just leave as is, not need to securely store it.

## Issuer

This is used to add the issuer to service tokens. This is configured as follows:

```yaml
server:
  v1:
    issuer: https://auth.falkowski.io
```

## Get Public Key

The service allows you to get the public key by kind. The supported kinds are the same as generating a key.

## Generate Service Tokens

Service tokens are generated using Ed25519 key pair. Once this is generated it is configured as follows:

```yaml
server:
  v1:
    key:
      ed25519:
        public: base64_public_key
        private: base64_private_key
```

The system generates service tokens from the access tokens. This is configured as follows:

```yaml
server:
  v1:
    services:
      - id: test-service
        hash: bcrypt-password
        duration: 24h
```

Each service has an id, hash and duration. The access token is generated by the access token service. The user then sends the access token as [Bearer Authentication](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/). This will give you an encrypted service token that is valid for the duration.

### JWT

The system will by default generate [JWT tokens](https://jwt.io/), or if we specify kind to be `jwt`.

### Branca

The system will generate a [branca token](https://branca.io/) if the kind that is passed in is `branca`. This is configured as follows:

```yaml
server:
  v1:
    secret:
      branca: random_32_character_string
```

### Paseto

The system will generate a [paseto token](https://github.com/paseto-standard/paseto-spec) if the kind that is passed in is `paseto`.
