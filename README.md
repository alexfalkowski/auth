# Auth

A service for all your authn and authz needs.

## Password

The service allows you to generate a secure password. The system uses:
- https://github.com/sethvargo/go-password
- https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt

We take recommendations from [NIST Password Guidelines](https://blog.netwrix.com/2022/11/14/nist-password-guidelines).

## Key

The service allows you to generate a secure RSA public and private keys. We take recommendations from [A Guide to RSA Encryption in Go](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/a-guide-to-rsa-encryption-in-go-1a18d827f35d).

The service also requires to have a public and a private key to be configured as such:

```yaml
server:
  v1:
    key:
      public: |
        -----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY-----
        ...
        -----END RSA PUBLIC KEY-----
      private: |
        -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
        ...
        -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

These keys should be stored and retrieved from an [application configuration system](https://github.com/alexfalkowski/konfig).

## Access Token

The service allows access tokens to be created that will be used to generate bearer tokens to be used to generate more bearer tokens like JWT. This is configured as follows:

```yaml
server:
  v1:
    admins:
      - id: su-1234
        hash: bcrypt-password
```

The password and hash is generated by the password service. The user then sends `id:password` as [basic auth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication). The password should be stored and retrieved from an [application configuration system](https://github.com/alexfalkowski/konfig).

The hash is safe to just leave as is, not need to securely store it.
